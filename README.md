## 🌿 Project Background

This was my **Milestone Project 3** during the Code Institute diploma.
The goal was to demonstrate **full CRUD functionality**, data persistence, and a user-friendly UI.
It also introduced me to **templating (Jinja2)** and organizing a Python Flask app with routes and models.
